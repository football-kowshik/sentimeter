    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "India winning a FIFA World Cup will need infrastructure, coaching, talent dev, governance reform — but sentiment matters because it fuels all of these things. If the pulse of the nation shows football is trending, emotional, demanded → resources, talent, and attention naturally follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Core Pillars of a World Cup Team\n",
    "\n",
    "For any country to realistically win a FIFA World Cup, four things are non-negotiable. Without these, it's impossible to compete at the top level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infrastructure** → proper pitches, academies, facilities.\n",
    "2. **Coaching** → high-level tactical + technical training from grassroots up.\n",
    "3. **Talent Development** → scouting, nurturing kids from age 6–7, feeding them into pro clubs.\n",
    "4. **Governance Reform** → efficient, corruption-free football bodies that prioritize long-term development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Where Sentiment Fits In\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might ask: what does fan sentiment have to do with these technical things? Here's the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentiment drives demand.** If millions of Indians are showing interest, passion, and emotional connection to football → government & private investors are more likely to pour money into infrastructure and academies.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment shapes accountability.** When fans are loudly frustrated about governance failures, it forces football bodies (AIFF, ISL clubs) to take reform seriously.\n",
    "3. **Sentiment inspires talent.** Kids are more likely to dream of being footballers if they see football is celebrated and not treated as a niche sport.\n",
    "4. **Sentiment attracts sponsors & media.** Positive hype = brands spend more money, leagues get more coverage, which leads to better salaries, better coaching, and higher professionalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Chain Reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "So the line basically means: India will only win a World Cup if we fix the hard football things (infrastructure, coaching, governance). But fan sentiment is the fuel that makes these fixes possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No sentiment → no demand → no resources → no progress.\n",
    "- Strong sentiment → strong demand → resources, reforms, and talent follow naturally."
